% Problem 1c goes below
\{ CID , TERM \} \rightarrow \{ SUBJ, CRSE, SEC,UNITS \} \\


I don't expect anything else to hold for students because CID and CRSE can be reused  \\

multiple SUBJ and SEC are super board so they encompass a large quantity of courses thus \\

there is a high chance they will be repeated somewhere

\{BUILD, TERM, CID, ROOM, DAY, TIME} \rightarrow \{INSTRUCTORS, TYPE\} \\

I only expect this to hold in meetings because there can only be one \\

one event that happens in the same building at the same day on the same time during \\

the same school year. Time and days can happen multiple times per ... forever \\

Type is definately not unique, as with instructors, and many meetings can happen in the same building \\

for students I expect

\{CID,TERM,SID,EMAIL\} \rightarrow \{Surname,Prefname,Class,Status,Seat,Email,Grade,Units,Major,Level\}

I dont expect anything else to hold because Seats can change depending on whether a student took multiple classes \\

Grade definately varies per class,  as does units. Level varies as a student spends more time in school \\

People can have the same pref name and surname, and status changes depending on time as well, the Email and SID \\

alone could be a key however, it doesnt determine alone because students can take multiple \\

classes and thus have different values assosiated to the same SID and Email \\

As for MVD's
\{ CID , TERM \} \doublerightarrow \{ SUBJ, CRSE, SEC,UNITS \} \\
\{BUILD, TERM, CID, ROOM, DAY, TIME} \rightarrow \{INSTRUCTORS, TYPE\} \\
\{CID,TERM,SID,EMAIL\} \rightarrow \{Surname,Prefname,Class,Status,Seat,Email,Grade,Units,Major,Level\} \\

all follow due to promotion , due to the fact these dependencies are keys, the compliment rule would not apply for MVD's \\
