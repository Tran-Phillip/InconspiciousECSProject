% Problem 1b goes below
We will be storing the course infomation into it's own table called course_tbl \\

We will store the CID,TERM,CRSE,SEC as integers with the CID as non-null\\

The Subj and Units will be stored as VARCHARs in order to accompny the fact that units may not be integers\\


For the meetings we will store it in a table called meetings_tbl \\

it will also take the CID and TERM as integers, but takes the INSTRUCTORS \\

TYPE, DAYS,TIME, BUILDING AND ROOM as VARCHARS as these tend to be strings and the ROOM isnt always an integer \\

Finally we will store the seating information into a table called seating_tbl \\

The seating tbl will take CID and TERM AS INTEGERS with SEAT, SID, SURNAME, and PREFNAMES as VARCHARS of size(20/30)\\

The level will always remain constant size of 4 so we made it CHAR(4) \\

The units will be taken in as a REAL number because they can be 3.5 and such \\

Finally, the CLASS, MAJOR, GRADE, STATUS, and EMAIL will be stored in VARCHARS\\

We also include an extra column called "CONVERTED GRADE" which stores the real number \\

equivalent of the GRADE obatined by the student.\\
